Unlike fields with established histories like accounting or finance, supply chain hasn\'t traditionally been a top choice recommended by parents. However, the pandemic has shifted perceptions, leading to a rise in interest among students. The value of strong supply chains has become apparent across various disciplines, with supply chain management modules attracting students from business, medicine, public health, and science and engineering backgrounds. Concepts like risk mitigation, resilience, and agility are gaining prominence, with students focusing on identifying and responding to risks. COVID-19 highlighted the importance of supply chain resilience, driving it to the forefront of research and teaching.

You don’t have parents telling their kids to go into supply chain. The pandemic has changed that and programs are noticing an uptick in interest.The value of strong supply chains has also become apparent to students in a range of disciplines. Since 2017, supply chain and operations a module in supply chain management in the health and medical devices sector. It attracts students from a range of disciplines within the Institutions, including business, medicine, public health, and science and engineering.The concepts of risk mitigation, resilience, and agility, while always important, are gaining prominence. Supply chain students will spend more time identifying, assessing, and responding to risk, supply chain talent strategies. While many in academia have been discussing the need for supply chain professionals to prepare for disruptive events, whether a natural disaster or pandemic, the benefits of doing so aren’t as easy to quantify as, for instance, cutting inventory costs. COVID-19 may change that.Supply chain resilience has also become an increasingly integral part of research and teaching. In teaching, this would be covered as a function of the level of redundancy and flexibility that can be built into the supply chain through choices made by policy and/or decision-makers.The pandemic also hammered home how uncertain the world is, and how future supply chain professionals need to hone their ability to solve problems even amidst uncertainty.
